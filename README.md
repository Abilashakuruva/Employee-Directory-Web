🧠 Reflection
🏗️ Challenges Faced

Building modals and filters without any external libraries.

Managing UI states and interactions manually in vanilla JS.

Ensuring responsive layout across screen sizes using only CSS.

🔧 If Given More Time
I would:

Implement data persistence using localStorage.

Add pagination and toast notifications.

Polish the UI with CSS transitions and accessibility enhancements.

Include automated testing for key UI flows.
